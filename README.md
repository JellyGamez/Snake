# Snake-Game
My very first project - a straightforward snake game written in C++ (python would've been funnier :c). 
The code could use some refinement, considering I was in my early stages of learning programming at the time.
 
## Features
- Move using **W A S D**
- Keeping track of the current score and highscore
- Options to change the snake speed, start a new game or quit
- 
## Project setup
- Windows

```sh
g++ main.cpp
```

- Linux

```sh
sudo apt-get install ncurses-dev
g++ main.cpp -lncurses
```

## Note
 The default terminal window may be too small, so make sure to resize it to fit the whole board and menu.
