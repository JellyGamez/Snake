# Snake-Game
 Simple snake game written in C++ (python would've been funnier :c). Also my first project ever made
 
## Features
- Move using **W A S D**

- Options to change the snake speed, start a new game or quit
- 
## Project setup

```sh
g++ main.cpp
```

## Note
 The default terminal window may be too small, so make sure to resize it to fit the whole board and menu.
